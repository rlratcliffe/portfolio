# Any Decision Record

In the context of creating ADRs, facing potential future problems with remembering why decisions were made I decided to use the minimal template of MADR to achieve a balance of documenting both decision and other considered options, with no known downsides at this time.

Note that per the title these will not just be decisions related to architecture but any changes.
